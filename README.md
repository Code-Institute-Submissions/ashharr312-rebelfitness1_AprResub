## Design 
#### Colour Scheme
* The 3 main colours that I have applied across the website are black, cadetblue and light gray.

#### Typography
* Lato is the main font that is used on all the pages with a fallback font of Sans Serif in case that the font is not able to be imported for any reason. Lato is a clean elegant font that is one of the most popularly used in web design at this design because it is attractive and easy to read.

#### Imagery
* Imagery plays a large part of the design of this website. There are banner style images across 4 out of 5 of the webpages with the final page having a large background image covering the span of the page. It is designed as such to inspire potential members through witnessing current member's fitness journeys while also showcasing the layout of the gym.
